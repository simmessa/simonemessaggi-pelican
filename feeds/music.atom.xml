&lt;h2&gt;Learning to play Flamenco guitar, the flamenco triplet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm mostly a guitar player. Even if I play other instruments somehow decently (such as &lt;a href="/2025/09/en/artec-poa4-pro-tone-precision-bass-27-euros/"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt;, for example) I'm still a guitar player at heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Learning to play Flamenco guitar, the flamenco triplet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm mostly a guitar player. Even if I play other instruments somehow decently (such as &lt;a href="/2025/09/en/artec-poa4-pro-tone-precision-bass-27-euros/"&gt;bass&lt;/a&gt;, for example) I'm still a guitar player at heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of it is due to my endless fascination with the Flamenco guitar style and its marvelous technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you might have heard about a technique called &lt;em&gt;"Rasgueado"&lt;/em&gt; and various other feats such as hitting the guitar body (&lt;em&gt;"Golpe"&lt;/em&gt;) to produce a characteristic sound and that &lt;strong&gt;mighty&lt;/strong&gt; tone that comes out of nylon strings and tonewood when in the right hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After trying to figure this out pretty much discontinuously for many years I might have figured it out: The &lt;strong&gt;flamenco triplet&lt;/strong&gt; is the base of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is a flamenco triplet? You may ask.
Well, it's a triplet, rhytmically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="music notation for a triplet" src="/images/triplet_notation.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wonderful thing is, when played fast enough, this technique generates a "bursting" guitar sound that is, for me, synonymous with flamenco style and I really love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanna hear an example? Here ya go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe allow="autoplay" frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/soundcloud%253Atracks%253A2192332175&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/simmessa" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="Simmessa"&gt;Simmessa&lt;/a&gt; · &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/simmessa/flamenco-triplet-crescendo" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank" title="flamenco triplet crescendo"&gt;flamenco triplet crescendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, a bit shabby but I guess I'm getting there, enough playing games... let's get serious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing the flamenco triplet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flamenco triplet is basically a sequence of three movements. Traditional flamenco players usually start their triplet with the thumbs up movement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The flamenco triplet when played UP DOWN DOWN" src="/images/flamenco_triplet_udd.png"/&gt;
This is a good way to do it, obsiously, but there's some downside, where does it work less well you may ask? When you want to add golpes (that is, strikes on the guitar body), this sequence might do but isn't exactly ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be able to add golpes at lightning speed just like the incredible Gabriela Quintero from the duo &lt;a href="https://www.rodgab.com/"&gt;Rodrigo y Gabriela&lt;/a&gt;, you might want to start you triplet with the fingers movement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The flamenco triplet when played DOWN DOWN UP" src="/images/flamenco_triplet_ddu.jpg"/&gt;
Keep doing this for a while and you will realize it's basically something you can do via wrist rotation alone, therefore the most important thing is this wrist rotation, if you practice a bit you can get fast enough so that the sound you get is continuous and you can also last a long time (eh, eh, humans always love this feat I know).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, if you wanna get fast at something technical on the guitar, and possibly at everything you need help from your best friend, the METRONOME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But playing the wrong movement with a metronome will get you nowhere fast, I fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where a little online tuition can go a loooong way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wonderful video content for you, aspiring Flamenco guitar player&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out a really excellent teacher online, her name is Edina Balczó and she goes by the channel "The Spanish Guitar Hub" on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheSpanishGuitarHub"&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt; and I'm pretty sure she will be able to teach me (and you), pretty much everything we need to know about flamenco triplets and other flamenco guitar concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's incredible, really, if you dig flamenco technique you should hit her channel now!
Also, she sells her lessons and course on her own website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thespanishguitarhub.com"&gt;https://www.thespanishguitarhub.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has dedicated many free videos on her youtube channel to the flamenco triplet, with variations such as how to play it with golpes, accents and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon her wonderful content when I was searching for a tutorial about playing Tamacun, an iconic New Flamenco song by the aforementioned duo: Rodrigo y Gabriela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video is phenomenal, in my humble opinion, you should check it out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, by the way, here's the original song that re-ignited the Flamenco sparkle for me, in a version where it's even more breathtaking (apart from the 240p quality :/)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SZbFLHlB8o4?si=QHNyPZ2gbJAaPwMe" title="YouTube video player" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a special find, here's a final video where the authors, Rodrigo and Gabriela themselves give us tips on how to play &lt;em&gt;Tamacun&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry, this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vUicl7N4LE"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; was non embeddable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Here's a quick test and the resulting experience of upgrading the stock pickups to the Artec POA4 Precision bass pickups for an HB DIY bass kit I built. The difference with the stock pickups is very detectable, in my opinion, but the newer pickups come with their own issue... Luckily, it's an easy fix! Check out the video for sound samples, my opinions and a before / after comparison of the bass sound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXKsPk_UORQ?si=TgulNkEDwJx8jQX_" title="YouTube video player" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stuck on a mediocre bass sound?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi there! back in 2009 I bought a precision bass kit from &lt;a href="https://www.thomann.com"&gt;Thomann&lt;/a&gt;, it was made by a then unknown brand called Harley Benton (!), it was way before they started selling complete instruments for very low price points.
Of course, they're a pretty popular brand as of today, but I guess you already know that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DIY bass package&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've checked the order confirmation email I got from Thomann and it seems I spent about 89 euros for mine. I checked on their website and I was able to track it down even today, it's now priced at 99 euros, and that's not too bad, less than the inflation rate anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to try building your next bass, I suggest you give one of these kits a try, as this was such a good learning experience for me. Of course it's a pretty basic instrument, right now my biggest issue with it is that the pickups sound a bit muddy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to Amazon to look for cheap alternatives to the onboard pickups. That's when I found out these &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4nhMLZu"&gt;alnico V pickups by Artec&lt;/a&gt;, for the low low price of 27 euros, a deal that looks pretty juicy to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was at it, I also decided to replace the pickup covers with these &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3IbAEOP"&gt;cream colored ones&lt;/a&gt;, it's 6 euros more to shell out but I found it useful to better match the color theme of the bass, which is what makes it so lovely to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A pleasant (sonic) surprise!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After replacing the pickups with the new ones I was pleased, these have more high end, a better low end and less muddines in the mids. I would call &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4nhMLZu"&gt;these Artec pickups&lt;/a&gt; more modern sounding alternatives to the stock pickups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of playing with the new pickups onboard, I've realized there's a new issue I didn't experience with the old ones... it happens when you accidentally touch the pole pieces when not touching the strings. It's an annoying buzzing noise that drives me crazy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ground those poles, ladies...&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of research online, I finally figured it out, the Artec pickups sound nice but the manufacturer didn't bother to ground the actual pole pieces! I've learned that even Fender original pickups often have the same issue, and that's pretty crazy, if you ask me, especially if you pay premium price for these. Thankfully, that's absolutely not our case ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, &lt;strong&gt;the fix isn't hard to do,&lt;/strong&gt; you just have to apply some adhesive foil or metal strip to the back of the pickups, touching the exposed poles, then solder a wire from one coil to the other, and finally wire a jumper to the pickup grounds, takes about 20 minutes with a soldering iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now, I hope you enjoyed my little test of the Artec Alnico V precision bass pickups, if you're the kind of person that subscribes to youtube channels, feel free to do so... or not! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wim is an established sessionman / studio guitar player in Belgium. Apart from being a performer, endorser, guitar instructor and clinician for many years, Wim is also a composer and songwriter, and "Burn" is his first solo CD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The album is composed of 10 original tracks, the genre is instrumental guitar rock, with some blues/fusion accents and also a little bit of funkiness, which never hurts, if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first track, with its meditative tones, is quite an unusual way to start such a record, but the phrasing is interesting, as the jazzy chord progression drives its way to the end about 6 minutes later, with the help of a tight rythm section. I think it's a good resume of Wim's musical taste, but I found it a little unfocused, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title track, one of the album's best moments, has a catchy melody, and is a nice showcase of Wim's guitaristic prowess. the guitar works are well executed and overall solid. Wim sure is a talented guitar player and he's capable of many different styles. His soloing is pretty conventional though, it shows good feeling but it gets somewhat repetitive after some listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of the other musicians involved in this project is truly first class, as it sounds inspired, like if the four have been playing together for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shades, the 3rd track, with its slower pace and bluesy roots, is also quite enjoyable. I found that it benefits quite a lot by the inclusion of background acoustic guitars and the occasional funky rythm guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Quickening 2 intro brought to memory some of Steve Morse works with his band, the four musicians play tightly and there's room for some harmonic exploration as well as some true shredding moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I'm pleased to say that Wim is the kind of guitarist which is more after good melodies rather than the showcase of mad guitar skills. I personally like his kind of approach, cause the world's full of soulless notes-per-second machines and awful songs, and this is not the case with Wim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the impression I received after repeated listenings of Burn is of a quite traditional guitar record. The production is about average, the kind of stuff you would expect from other guitar "solo" albums, and I guess this doesn't help much the "novelty factor". Maybe a less conventional approach could have made this record more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bronze is another delicate, acoustic rock/fusion ballad, and like "in your eyes" it doesn't hurt, but it doesn't either add much to the overall character of the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kickstart 2 oriental feeling is welcomed as a good change to the record's uniformity of style. The guitar's heavier sound leave a distinct mark but I found the bass the most convincing trait of this track. The soloing is, again, good but didn't strike me as particuarly original or new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karnak Karma, on the other hand, is maybe the most original of all the included tracks, with its ethnic character and the 2/4 drumming, I would say it's refreshing and therefore, a good variation of Wim's musical tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resume this album in a sentence, I would say "Burn" is a solid instrumental record with the predominance of softer, more melodic tracks. Even without truly excelling at anything in particular it's surely worth listening, especially if you're into melodic guitar works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wim cites Satriani, Steve Vai and John Petrucci as his main influences, but I found his style also very close to that of guitarist Andy Timmons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I you like this records I suggest that you check out also:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember listening to "Hail to England" &amp;amp; "Into glory ride" at least a thousand times. And I'm still doing so once in a while, with a different spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the very best part was the videotape, containing a sort of documentary of all things Manowar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen it many times and I used to remember all the hymns and slogans it contained, something very close to a religious cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit this "True Metal" thing is mostly bullshit but I recognize it was very fun at the time and I don't regret being a Manowar zealot, it didn't last much though.&lt;/p&gt;
