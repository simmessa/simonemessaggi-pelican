*Of course, as is appropriate, my prediction is far from true, and after a number of years Ghost seems more dead than alive, the original article was dated August 21, 2014 when it appeared on [Simmessa.com](Simmessa.com), yet, in 2025 I feel like the "omen" is actually becoming a lot closer to reality...*

I'm writing this post from the bed of a mountain attic. I don't feel no remorse. I don't need an app, just a smartphone browser. Of course my knowledge of **markdown** is quite limited at the moment, so I don't expect this to become my greatest looking post to date.

The incredible thing is to be able to do it with this ease, while totally on the loose.

No options, *write > save > publish* unfortunately I would like so many things to be automatic, like *publicize* with autopost on twitter and facebook. But it's too early, and they say that those who are satisfied enjoy a lot more.

I think [ghost](https://ghost.org/) can be the right platform to bridge between traditional blogging and microblogging.

The ease of use certainly plays in its favor, I guess we will be seeing in the coming years.

Sorry about the non-technical post, it's not easy to write markdown from a mountain attic :)

See you soon.

_A Note from future self: Ghost is soooo dead, over the years I switched this blog over to Gatsby, which was acquired by Netlify in 2023, therefore declared dead in its own regard...So in 2025 I finally switched to Pelican, which is based on Python rather than NodeJS, and that's for the better. I will let you know if this is meant to last more than a few years..._
