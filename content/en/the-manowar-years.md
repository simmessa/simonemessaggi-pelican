When I was a kid I used to be a huge Manowar fan for maybe 1 or two years.

One of my best friend got this Manowar double cd + videotape set which was very epic and fun (Hey Ace, how's it going?)

I remember listening to "Hail to England" &amp; "Into glory ride" at least a thousand times. And I'm still doing so once in a while, with a different spirit.

But the very best part was the videotape, containing a sort of documentary of all things Manowar.

I've seen it many times and I used to remember all the hymns and slogans it contained, something very close to a religious cult.

I admit this "True Metal" thing is mostly bullshit but I recognize it was very fun at the time and I don't regret being a Manowar zealot, it didn't last much though.

If you feel nostalgic you can always chek the videotape I'm talking about, as some pious soul finally put it up on YouTube, the internet pulsating collective Memory / Soul.

It's called **Secret of Steel**, and it brought back so many memories!

_Note from the future: This was some of the worst rock'n'roll sexist macho male stuff out there, totally unconceivable today, but it was so funny, I don't believe in these valors honestly, but please don't stigmatize / cancel this and learn from the past to make sense of the present and future times! Also, the youtube video might be gone or could be seen only on their damn platform, I didn't upload it and honestly I can't control it in any way, sorry._
