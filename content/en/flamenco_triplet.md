## Learning to play Flamenco guitar, the flamenco triplet

I'm mostly a guitar player. Even if I play other instruments somehow decently (such as [bass](/2025/09/en/artec-poa4-pro-tone-precision-bass-27-euros/), for example) I'm still a guitar player at heart.

Part of it is due to my endless fascination with the Flamenco guitar style and its marvelous technique.

Well, you might have heard about a technique called _"Rasgueado"_ and various other feats such as hitting the guitar body (_"Golpe"_) to produce a characteristic sound and that **mighty** tone that comes out of nylon strings and tonewood when in the right hands.

After trying to figure this out pretty much discontinuously for many years I might have figured it out: The **flamenco triplet** is the base of it all.

But what is a flamenco triplet? You may ask.
Well, it's a triplet, rhytmically:

The wonderful thing is, when played fast enough, this technique generates a "bursting" guitar sound that is, for me, synonymous with flamenco style and I really love it.

Wanna hear an example? Here ya go:

Ok, a bit shabby but I guess I'm getting there, enough playing games... let's get serious!

## Playing the flamenco triplet

A flamenco triplet is basically a sequence of three movements. Traditional flamenco players usually start their triplet with the thumbs up movement:

This is a good way to do it, obsiously, but there's some downside, where does it work less well you may ask? When you want to add golpes (that is, strikes on the guitar body), this sequence might do but isn't exactly ideal.

If you want to be able to add golpes at lightning speed just like the incredible Gabriela Quintero from the duo [Rodrigo y Gabriela](https://www.rodgab.com/), you might want to start you triplet with the fingers movement:

Keep doing this for a while and you will realize it's basically something you can do via wrist rotation alone, therefore the most important thing is this wrist rotation, if you practice a bit you can get fast enough so that the sound you get is continuous and you can also last a long time (eh, eh, humans always love this feat I know).

Generally speaking, if you wanna get fast at something technical on the guitar, and possibly at everything you need help from your best friend, the METRONOME.

But playing the wrong movement with a metronome will get you nowhere fast, I fear.

That's where a little online tuition can go a loooong way.

## Wonderful video content for you, aspiring Flamenco guitar player

I found out a really excellent teacher online, her name is Edina Balczó and she goes by the channel "The Spanish Guitar Hub" on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@TheSpanishGuitarHub) and I'm pretty sure she will be able to teach me (and you), pretty much everything we need to know about flamenco triplets and other flamenco guitar concepts.

She's incredible, really, if you dig flamenco technique you should hit her channel now!
Also, she sells her lessons and course on her own website:

[https://www.thespanishguitarhub.com](https://www.thespanishguitarhub.com)

She has dedicated many free videos on her youtube channel to the flamenco triplet, with variations such as how to play it with golpes, accents and so on.

I stumbled upon her wonderful content when I was searching for a tutorial about playing Tamacun, an iconic New Flamenco song by the aforementioned duo: Rodrigo y Gabriela.

The video is phenomenal, in my humble opinion, you should check it out:

And, by the way, here's the original song that re-ignited the Flamenco sparkle for me, in a version where it's even more breathtaking (apart from the 240p quality :/)

As a special find, here's a final video where the authors, Rodrigo and Gabriela themselves give us tips on how to play *Tamacun*:
